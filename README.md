## My process

I laid out my groundwork again using pseudo code and a notepad to map out containers and help break the end-goal down. I started with semantic HTML5 markup and insuring to use easily identifiable classes and IDs for improved readability. Afterwards, I worked on the CSS with a top-down approach -- tweaking previous sections as I moved further down.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

The biggest learning point for this project is how far I've progressed since starting to learn front-end development. I was able to complete about 90% of this project in about an hour and thirty minutes. A previous simpler product took me roughly 3 hours when I didn't really know anything.

### Continued development

As usual, I plan to continue development on the foundations of HTML and CSS. Additionally, I've been learning JS through a Udemy course and other resources, so I'm excited to try tackling JS challenges. I alo want to revisit previous projects and completely overhaul them with a framework like Bootstrap and some minor JS.
